# DDT policy dates (from Jeanette and Noel): Jeanette: When we last met, we
# decided that it would be interesting to see some date ranges for when
# various countries started and finished using DDT (vs. single points
# showing when it was banned). So, here are the ranges for a few countries
# (final date represents total ban on use within the country):
#
# It would be great to see what this would look like on our DDT graph. I
# think it was suggested that the ranges be represented by shaded bars? I
# could come up with some more countries, but I think it would get pretty
# crowded with any more.
