# African elephant population estimates

# Sean: What the heck is the difference between Probable, Possible, and Speculative?
# Brett: It's a bizarre thing that they do for elephant populations in the elephant
# database.  There are multiple paragraphs about it, but basically "definite"
# is your lower estimate.  Those are elephants for which there is very strong
# evidence that they exist (i.e. robust sampling programs done by aerial
# monitoring and other good methods).  From probably to speculative, the
# estimates are increasingly dodgy (poor sampling methods, extrapolation
# beyond the data, that sort of thing).
# 
# I think the best way to present those would be a lower limit (definite only)
# and an upper limit (definite + all 3 of the other categories), rather than
# trying to interpret the differences between those categories.  The other
# ones don't even try to quantify uncertainty, they just give an estimate.
#
# Sean: so the upper limit column is just the sum of the probable, possible, and speculative columns
# and the estimate column (furthest on right) for the recent years is the average of the low and high values
